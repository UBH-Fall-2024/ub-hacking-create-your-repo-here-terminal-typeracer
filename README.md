Made in <24 hours for a hackathon. I won the "Spirit of the Hackathon" award :tada:


Try it out at
```bash
ssh terminal-typeracer.us -p 23234

# If the above doesn't work, try this
ssh 45.55.159.44 -p 23234
```
Use ctrl-c to quit


### Inspiration
[typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) and [terminal.shop](https://www.terminal.shop/)

### What it does
You can play typeracer in the terminal over ssh


### How I built it
[Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and lots of love

### Challenges I ran into
I Severely underestimated how much time I had to do this. Luckily I managed to get an MVP without too much trouble.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Wrote my own networking protocol using just raw TCP.
- Working ssh server that I can go onto whenever I want

### What I learned
i got some more experience with go and I learned how to host things outside of my local network

### What's next for Terminal Typeracer
Clean up the UI, make it easier to join and leave lobbies
